# Docker

There are tons of resources about docker, so I'd like to let others to explain about it.

## Getting started

Please check the [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/).

## Examples

### Hello World

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

## Development

### VS Code

1. Install [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
